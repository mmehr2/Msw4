<P>Bookmarks and paperclips are ways of saving locations in your script that you 
can navigate quickly to later. In edit mode, an icon is drawn on the
<a href="cue_bar.htm">cue bar</a> next to each line that contains either a 
bookmark or a paperclip. Hot keys for setting and navigating bookmarks and 
paperclips exist in both <a href="edit_window_navigation.htm">edit mode</a> and
<a href="scroll_window_navigation.htm">scroll mode</a> for your convenience.</P>

<P>Bookmarks are named markers used most commonly in edit mode. When you set a 
bookmark, you will be prompted for a name up to 30 characters long. Bookmarks 
cannot be set while in scroll mode. The name of each bookmark must be unique. If 
you wish to save your bookmarks when the script is closed, the document must be 
saved in rich text format (.RTF).</P>

paperclips when the script is closed, the document must be saved in rich text
