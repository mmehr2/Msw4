  <b><font face="arial" size="2"><span name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">Use It!</span></font></b></p>
  <p>
  <font face="arial" size="2"><span name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">Of 
  everything you can do to optimize Windows XP, one of the simplest is just to 
  use it. As you launch and exploit applications, Windows observes your behavior 
  and updates a dynamic file called Layout.ini. After every three days, when it 
  senses that the computer is idle, it rearranges the locations of programs on 
  the system hard drive to optimize their launch and execution.</span></font></p>
  <font face="arial" size="2"><span name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">
  <p nd="2"><b><span nd="1" class="content9"><a name="Visual"></a>Icons and Wallpaper</span></b></p>
  <p nd="2">Excessive desktop icons and desktop wallpaper take up their share of 
  system memory, and they're constantly refreshed by the graphics subsystems. 
  Animated desktops are particularly hard on a system's core resources.&nbsp; 
  The performance hit leveraged by such minor glitter is minimal, however, so as 
  long as your system has more than 128MB of RAM and a semi-modern processor 
  (something in the range of 600MHz or faster) then don't worry too much about 
  icons and wallpaper. However, if you're limping along with 64MB of RAM on a 
  200MHz Pentium Pro, then every clock cycle is critical.</p>
  <p nd="6"><b><span nd="5" class="content9">Cut Down on the Effects</span></b></p>
  <p nd="7">All of the visual splendor of XP can degrade the responsiveness of 
  the user interface. XP runs a few tests to auto-configure its GUI settings for 
  a mix of beauty and usability, but its decisions are easily overridden.</p>
  <p nd="8">Some of the settings are accessed through the Appearance tab on the 
  Display Properties, which you can evoke by right-clicking on an empty area of 
  the desktop and selecting Properties. Click on the Effects button and you can 
  tweak the menu transitions, shadows and font properties.&nbsp; </p>
  <p nd="9">You can further tweak GUI performance through the System Properties 
  tool. Open it through Control Panel or by right-clicking on My Computer and 
  selecting Properties. Choose the Advanced tab. A radio button lets you 
  optimize for performance, or you can customize your mix from a list of 
  check-boxed visual effects options&nbsp; Click on the Advanced tab of the 
  Performance Options dialog and ensure that processor scheduling and memory 
  usage are configured for programs.<!-- start ziffimage //--></p>
  <p nd="2"><b><span nd="1" class="content9"><a name="User switching"></a>Fast-User Switching</span></b></p>
  <p nd="2">Available on XP Home Edition and on Professional when it's not part 
  of a domain, fast user switching lets users of the same computer switch 
  between accounts without logging off. Keeping multiple user accounts active is 
  a burden to a PC's memory usage. Windows XP automatically disables fast user 
  switching during installation if the computer has 64MB of RAM or less. For 
  best performance, make sure only one user is logged in at a time, and if that 
  becomes a nuisance, disable the feature altogether: go to Control Panel\User 
  Accounts, click the &quot;Change the way users log on or off&quot; button, and uncheck 
  &quot;Use Fast User Switching&quot;. </p>
  <p nd="7"><b><span nd="6" class="content9"><a name="auto-update"></a>Automatic Updating</span></b></p>
  <p nd="7">You should always keep Windows up to date with the latest security 
  fixes, DirectX versions, compatibility patches and other updates. By default, 
  XP will do this for you--but this requires a small program to run in the 
  background and occasionally check, or remind you to check, for Windows 
  revisions. If you'd rather handle the task of updating Windows yourself, you 
  can tell XP not to bother. Head to the Automatic Updates tab in the System 
  Properties tool. You can elect to have Windows detect and download updates 
  automatically, to have the OS check for updates and notify you when they are 
  available, or not to do anything. </p>
  <p nd="2"><b><span nd="1" class="content9"><a name="system restore"></a>System Restore</span></b></p>
  <p nd="2">System Restore creates periodic snapshots of 
  your critical system files (like the registry files, COM+ database, user 
  profiles, and such) and stores them as a &quot;restore point.&quot; Should you install 
  an application that hoses your system, or if something important gets 
  corrupted, you can revert the computer to the state it was in at a restore 
  point and go on happily using it. Restore points are automatically created by the System Restore 
  service upon several events, such as when a new application is installed, a 
  Windows update is applied, an unsigned driver is installed, or some other 
  event occurs that could have a negative effect on the
  operating system. You may create manual restore points through System 
  Restore's main interface, which you can access through 
  Start\Programs\Accessories\System Tools\System Restore. </p>
  <p nd="5">System Restore does require a service to run in the background that 
  has a minimal performance impact, and its recorded backups take up hard drive 
  space. You can control how much space it's allowed (which affects how many 
  restore points it can create), and shut it down entirely, through the System 
  Restore tab in the System Properties tool. </p>
  <p nd="6">The System Restore dialog lists each active drive partition. You can 
  adjust the percentage of space that System Restore is allowed to work with on 
  each one. There's also a checkbox that allows you to shut down System Restore 
  entirely for all drives. </p>
  <p><b><span class="content9"><font nd="8" face="arial" size="2">
  <a name="defrag"></a>Defrag Regularly</font></span></b></p>
  <p><font nd="9" face="arial" size="2">Fragmentation is when gaps of free space 
  open up in various areas of the hard drive as programs and files are installed 
  and removed; later, other files are written starting at the first block of 
  free space, filling the gaps in order by sector and ending up scattered in 
  pieces all over the drive. When an operating system has to access several 
  different areas of a hard disk just to load a single file or program, 
  performance is severely degraded. </font></p>
  <p><font nd="10" face="arial" size="2">Windows XP takes measures when used 
  with the NTFS file system to keep hard disks contiguous--but fragmentation 
  still does occur. Therefore, you should defrag your XP hard disk(s) on a 
  regular basis depending on how much file juggling you do on your PC. </font>
  <font nd="11" face="arial" size="2">If you install and remove programs 
  frequently, or if you're constantly creating, moving and deleting data files, 
  you should defrag the drive as often as once per week. If, however, you tend 
  to use the same applications for long periods of time and you don't move files 
  around too often, you can get away with defragging your drives less 
  frequently, as seldom as once a month. </font></p>
  <p><font nd="12" face="arial" size="2">If you defrag your hard disks often 
  enough, you won't notice a change in performance immediately after defragging. 
  That's a <i>good</i> thing. If your computer is noticeably more responsive 
  right after defragging, you've let it go too long. </font></p>
  <p><b><span class="content9"><font nd="13" face="arial" size="2">Purge 
  Unneeded Background Clutter</font></span></b></p>
  <p><font nd="14" face="arial" size="2">Programs that run needlessly in the 
  background degrade the performance of foreground applications and games. TSRs 
  hog system memory, increase page file swapping, and monopolize the CPU for 
  tasks that aren't particularly necessary.&nbsp; </font>
  <font nd="15" face="arial" size="2">You can see what's going on in the 
  background by launching the Task Manager, which is invoked by simultaneously 
  pressing CTRL, ALT and DEL. Unlike Windows 9x, XP differentiates between 
  active end-user applications and system processes. Click on the Processes task 
  to see a list of system processes and TSRs floating around behind the curtain. 
  You can also shut down programs and processes from here, which you'll 
  occasionally want to do if something hangs up on you. </font></p>
  <p><font nd="16" face="arial" size="2">You'll recognize some of them straight 
  out. If you're running an

  antivirus program</a>, for example, you'll see its background process listed. 
  You may see processes that do everything from configure your mouse (like the 
  ubiquitous EM_EXEC.EXE) to the default Windows shell EXPLORER.EXE. </font></p>
  <p><font nd="17" face="arial" size="2">If you're a 9x user, some of the 
  processes will be totally unfamiliar. SERVICES.EXE, WINLOGON.EXE, SYSTEM, and 
  others. Services are discussed below. </font></p>
  <p><b><span align="left" class="content9"><a name="start up"></a>MSCONFIG</span></b></p>
  <p nd="1">Like versions of Windows 9x, from 98 on, XP contains the System 
  Configuration Utility (or SCU). Invoke it by running MSCONFIG at the Run 
  command line. It's great for experimenting with startup applications. The SCU 
  main interface contains several tabs that allow users to selectively and 
  non-permanently alter several startup parameters. The first two, SYSTEM.INI 
  and WIN.INI, are included for the purpose of legacy compatibility; there's 
  very little chance you'll ever need to tweak them. </p>
  <p nd="5">The Services tab lets you check and uncheck XP services, but there's 
  a better way to go about enabling and disabling them that we'll get to later.
  </p>
  <p nd="6">Under the Startup tab, you'll find a listing of each program that's 
  called to start after Windows XP is booted up. It's here that you can disable 
  things that you suspect are unnecessary, such as Microsoft Office's TSR, 
  Quicken Agent, launchers employed by multimedia programs like RealPlayer and 
  WinAmp, and other such nonsense. The beauty of the SCU is that disabled items 
  aren't permanently deleted: you can uncheck particular components, reboot, and 
  then test your applications and hardware. If you determine that something has 
  ceased to function, you can fire the SCU back up, recheck the box next to the 
  startup item in question, and reboot. </p>
  <p nd="7">You can often improve system performance vastly by experimenting 
  with the SCU and eliminating everything that isn't absolutely necessary. Once 
  you've determined a particular startup item to be useless, you can purge it 
  from wherever it's being called by checking its location in the SCU listing. 
  Items shown to be in &quot;Common Startup&quot; are called through the Start Menu's 
  Startup group--delete their icons and they won't be launched anymore. </p>
  <p nd="8">Items launched via the registry can be purged through the REGEDIT 
  program (after, of course, you've carefully backed up the registry in case you 
  accidentally alter something critical). They're most often located 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key. Simply 
  delete their values to prevent them from being launched on subsequent Windows 
  boots. </p>
  <p><b><span align="left" class="content9"><a name="Services"></a>Services</span></b></p>
  <p><i>Entire articles and even books have been written about managing 
  services, and we can't explain every nuance and aspect of them here. If you're 
  unsure about a particular service, don't alter it.</i></p>
  <p>Services are generally considered important components of operating system 
  code that provide functionality for various hardware, applications, tasks, and 
  so on. Of course, you shouldn't attempt to disable core operating system 
  kernel processes and related services that manage process scheduling, 
  interrupt handing, file management, virtual memory management, etc. But in our 
  context, there are many less critical services, invoked by default, layered 
  atop or working alongside the core operating system services that may be 
  disabled or modified to improve system responsiveness or performance, without 
  serious side effects. </p>
  <p nd="3">You can launch the Services control applet either through Control 
  Panel/Administrative Tools/Services (if using the &quot;classic view&quot; of the 
  Control Panel, or look within the Performance and Maintenance section when 
  using the new &quot;category view&quot; of the Control Panel), or by running 
  SERVICES.MSC from the Run command line. </p>
  <p nd="4">You'll see a list box that contains every service available to user 
  modification in your Windows XP configuration. Each entry contains a 
  description of the service (which you can view in better detail by clicking on 
  the service in question), its status (whether it's been started or not), its 
  startup type (automatic, manual or disabled), and the user account with which 
  the service logs on to the computer (unless you're far too advanced a user to 
  benefit from this article, don't change this). </p>
  <p nd="5">Services whose startup setting is Automatic will start when Windows 
  starts. Manual services can be started by the user or if a dependant service 
  (a service that cannot function without another service) is invoked. Disabled 
  services won't start at all. </p>
  <p nd="6">For pure performance, you can stop a number of services and/or set 
  them on manual. Don't <i>disable</i> a service unless you're absolutely sure 
  that no other services or hardware needs it. </p>
  <p nd="7">For example, if you've disabled System Restore, you can stop its 
  service and set it on manual. If you don't record CD-Rs, you can do the same 
  to the IMAPI CD-Burning COM service. The Portable Media Serial Number service 
  is pretty much useless, so feel free to set it on manual (or disable it if you 
  don't have a portable music player). If you don't do any printing, shut down 
  the Print Spooler service. Most users can set the Help and Support service on 
  manual (advanced users may want to disable it). If you don't use themes, turn 
  off the service. </p>
  <p nd="8">Experiment with stopping other services cautiously. You may never 
  need services like Telnet, Error Reporting, Task Scheduler (which is different 
  than the core operating system process scheduler, and operates at the user 
  application level), Indexing Service, Fast User Switching, ClipBook, 
  Distributed Transaction Coordinator, Internet Connection Firewall/Sharing (ICF/ICS), 
  and others. If you're unsure about a particular service, leave it alone. <i>
  Point of clarification - forum member MURDOCDV reminded us that the Task 
  Scheduler is used in auto-tuning operations - it assists in the creation of 
  prefetch information for prefetching disk-resident code and data (as we 
  alluded earlier), so it's NOT a good idea to disable the Task Scheduler. 
  Thanks MURDOCDV!</i> </p>
  <p nd="9">You can find out more about each service, including any dependent 
  services or services upon which <i>it</i> depends, through its property sheet.

  <p><b><span align="left" class="content9"><a name="tweak"></a>Use a Tweak 
  Utility</span></b></p>
  <p nd="1">Even though XP offers a wealth of ways to tinker with its settings, 
  Microsoft kept some of the nitty-gritty hardcore tweaks undocumented, with the 
  only way to change them being to dig deep in the registry, experiment, and 
  hope for the best. Don't bother, though, there's a better way:
  <a href="http://www.totalidea.de/frameset-tweakxp.htm" target="_blank">
  Tweak-XP</a> is a full-featured shareware utility that gives users access to a 
  vast range of configurable options, from minor GUI adjustments to 
  performance-affecting cache and memory tweaks. The program is fully functional 
  for 50 executions, after which you must register for $29.95 to continue using 
  it.</p>
  <p nd="1">Upon installation, Tweak-XP creates a system restore point so that 
  should you hose your system with it, you can recover quickly. Its little 
  interface is divided into four tabs, offering several pages of shortcuts and 
  tweaks for system performance options, desktop tweaks, Internet connection 
  streamlining, security tweaks, and so on. Most of the tweaks offered are 
  easily adjusted through checkboxes and sliders, and some are explained in 
  Tweak-XP's help file--although the program would benefit with more thorough 
  descriptions of its functions. </p>
  <p nd="4">While a discussion of Tweak-XP's entire feature set would fill a 
  book, we can recommend a few quick enhancements in its System Performance 
  section to speed up general Windows performance: </p>
  <ul>
    <li nd="5">If you have 512MB of RAM or more, experiment with the Core System 
    Performance checkbox on the Cache Optimization page. This option forces XP's 
    core code into memory and prevents it from being paged to a swap file. Most 
    general operations will be more responsive with this option checked, but if 
    you run several big programs simultaneously you may find the amount of 
    paging actually increases, because the OS kernel takes up RAM that would 
    otherwise be used for your applications.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li nd="6">Under Hardware Tweaks, select your system's CPU from the list. 
    Tweak-XP claims to implement unspecified tweaks for various graphics card 
    chipsets, but our testing didn't reveal any in-game frame rate changes after 
    using this feature. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li nd="7">Before you launch a large program such as a game, a spreadsheet 
    or a graphics suite, use Tweak-XP's RAM optimizer to reorganize your 
    computer's memory and clear up unneeded data. Be sure to fill in the &quot;Clear 
    the clipboard on every optimization&quot; checkbox.</li>
