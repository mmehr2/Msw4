<P>The script queue helps you manage scrolling order, track run times, and 
navigate all your open scripts. The first column in the list of scripts shows a 
checkbox that indicates whether the script will be displayed in scroll mode. 
Click in the second column to see a list of bookmarks for each script. Clicking 
on a bookmark makes that script active and navigates to the bookmark. The ERT 
column is a computed estimated run time, based on the CPS (characters per 
second) setting in the <a href="preferences.htm">preferences dialog box</a>. The 
last column displays each script's ART (actual run time) which can be set by 
clicking on the timer button on the <a href="control_panel.htm">control panel</a>.</P>

<P>The status bar at the bottom of the window shows the number of scripts queued 
(checked) and the sum of the ERTs and ARTs for queued scripts.</P>
